## Project Title

Dots.

## Description

This project consists of an html file, css and javascript simply to display a menu and draw dots on the screen using variables supplied by the user.
By it self this is rather stupid use of SVG but the purpose is to develop a generic framework for the user interaction and the screen filling SVG image.
The menu should work across platforms.
